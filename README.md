# scsm-tqec-persistence
Phase-I complete speculative physics framework modeling persistence as TQEC-protected superselection sectors. Claims are adversarially toy-validated, negative results preserved, and detectable mediator phenomenology eliminated. The framework is tightly scoped, internally consistent, and explicitly falsifiable via a single boundary-scale experiment.
