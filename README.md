# scsm-tqec-persistence

A Phase-I complete speculative physics framework realizing **identity persistence**
as a **topologically protected superselection structure**, using tools from
Topological Quantum Error Correction (TQEC) and open-system boundary dynamics.

This repository contains the **physics-filtered survivor** of the broader
Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM): all ambiguous, unfalsifiable,
or experimentally indistinguishable mechanisms have been explicitly eliminated.

---

## What This Work Claims

- **Persistence stability** can be realized as a *topological property* of
  superselection sectors, mathematically grounded via TQEC-style protection.
- Such sectors exhibit **exponentially suppressed leakage** under local noise
  (existence proof level).
- **Embodiment** is treated as an *open-system boundary problem* with explicit
  coherence thresholds.
- A **single, decisive experimental test** (boundary-scale force measurement)
  is identified for Phase-II.

---

## What This Work Does *Not* Claim

- No empirical confirmation to date.
- No full embedding into a completed theory of quantum gravity.
- No panpsychist, teleological, or substrate-independent persistence.
- No detectable mediator fields (all χ phenomenology is explicitly ruled out).
- No passive spectral or coincidence-based signatures.

## Project Status

- **Version:** v11.5.3  
- **Phase-I:** **100% complete**  
- **Validation:** 15 adversarial toy models (Toy11–Toy15 define Phase-I closure)
- **Remaining claims:** small, explicit, and falsifiable

See [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) for a concise maturity and falsifiability overview.

## Lineage Note

Earlier ontological and exploratory versions of SCSM are preserved in separate
repositories for provenance. This repository represents the **physics-constrained,
Phase-I complete endpoint** of that process.
