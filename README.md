# scsm-tqec-persistence

A Phase-I complete speculative physics framework realizing **identity persistence**
as a **topologically protected superselection structure**, using tools from
Topological Quantum Error Correction (TQEC) and open-system boundary dynamics.

This repository contains the **physics-filtered survivor** of the broader
Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM): all ambiguous, unfalsifiable,
or experimentally indistinguishable mechanisms have been explicitly eliminated.

---

## What This Work Claims

- **Persistence stability** can be realized as a *topological property* of
  superselection sectors, mathematically grounded via TQEC-style protection.
- Such sectors exhibit **exponentially suppressed leakage** under local noise
  (existence proof level).
- **Embodiment** is treated as an *open-system boundary problem* with explicit
  coherence thresholds.
- A **single, decisive experimental test** (boundary-scale force measurement)
  is identified for Phase-II.

---

## What This Work Does *Not* Claim

- No empirical confirmation to date.
- No full embedding into a completed theory of quantum gravity.
- No panpsychist, teleological, or substrate-independent persistence.
- No detectable mediator fields (all χ phenomenology is explicitly ruled out).
- No passive spectral or coincidence-based signatures.

## Project Status

Version: v11.5.3

Phase-I: 100% complete (15 synthetic adversarial toys) ✓

Phase-Ia: 100% complete (Toy16 real-data validation) ✓

Validation: 16 adversarial toys (Toy11–Toy16 define Phase-I/Ia closure)

Remaining claims: small, explicit, and falsifiable

See STATUS.md for full maturity overview.

## Lineage Note

Earlier ontological and exploratory versions of SCSM are preserved in separate
repositories for provenance. This repository represents the **physics-constrained,
Phase-I complete endpoint** of that process.

> **Summary:**  
> Lean, falsifiable framework that survived 16 adversarial toys + first real-data test (Toy16 Aalto Casimir). Single Phase-II biological test remains.
