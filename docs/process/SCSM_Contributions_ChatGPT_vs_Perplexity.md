# SCSM Phase-I Development Contributions  
## Tooling and Process Summary (ChatGPT & Perplexity)

**Project:** Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)  
**Version:** v11.5.3  
**Phase:** Phase-I (Complete)  
**Date:** December 27, 2025

This document provides a **process-level audit trail** describing how
different tools were used during Phase-I development. It exists for
transparency and historical record only.

## 1. ChatGPT Contributions (Prior Sessions)

ChatGPT was used as a **structural and consistency assistant** across
multiple earlier sessions.

Primary roles included:
- Formalizing early ontological axioms (v6.0) into mathematical language
  using TQEC and open-system (Lindblad) formalisms.
- Assisting with scope discipline by repeatedly stress-testing claims
  against falsifiability and internal consistency.
- Helping refactor theory language during v7–v10 to ensure alignment
  between mathematical structure and stated claims.
- Supporting adversarial reasoning by identifying potential overclaims,
  ambiguities, and metaphysical leakage.

ChatGPT did **not** introduce new scientific claims and did not perform
numerical simulations.

## 2. Perplexity Contributions (This Session)

Perplexity was used during this session as a **summarization and synthesis
assistant**, specifically focused on Toy15 and Phase-I closure documentation.

Key contributions included:
- Assisting with the structured summary of **Toy15**, matching the
  established Phase-I toy format.
- Documenting the outcome of strong nonlinear / threshold χ tests
  (0% recovery under adversarial conditions).
- Helping consolidate Phase-I status to **100% complete** following
  Toy15 closure.
- Assisting with file separation and naming conventions for GitHub
  readiness (toy summaries, work summaries).

Perplexity did **not** introduce new theory or modify existing claims.

## 3. Division of Labor (Human + Tools)

| Role | Responsibility |
|----|----|
| Human author (Sam DeRenzis) | Theory design, toy execution, interpretation, claim decisions |
| ChatGPT | Structural reasoning, consistency checks, scope discipline |
| Perplexity | Session-level summarization and documentation support |

All scientific judgments, claim inclusions, and eliminations were made
by the human author.

## 4. Session Timeline (Abbreviated)

- **12:27** — Toy15 results summarized and integrated  
- **12:28** — Phase-I closure confirmed  
- **12:29** — File separation and repo structure clarified  
- **12:30** — Phase-I completeness validated  
- **12:31** — Work summary consolidated  
- **12:33** — Process documentation drafted (this file)

## 5. Scope Clarification

- This document does **not** establish authorship priority.
- This document does **not** validate scientific claims.
- This document does **not** substitute for peer review.
- This document is **not referenced** by the theory or results.

It exists solely to document tooling usage during Phase-I.

---

## 6. Status

- **Phase-I:** Complete  
- **Theory:** Frozen at v11.5.3  
- **Tooling role:** Documented and closed  

No further updates to this document are expected unless future phases
explicitly document tooling changes.
