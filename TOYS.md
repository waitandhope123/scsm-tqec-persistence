# Phase-I Toy Model Program

## Purpose and Scope

This document summarizes the **adversarial toy models** used to stress-test,
refine, and (where necessary) eliminate claims made by the Speculative
Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM).

Only toy models that were:
- decision-driving,
- adversarial by construction,
- and run through to completion

are included here.

Exploratory or superseded simulations are intentionally excluded.

## Design Philosophy

Each toy model was constructed to answer a single question:

> *Can this claim survive contact with realistic noise, null models,
> and adversarial conditions?*

Accordingly, every toy:
- included nulls designed to fake signals,
- punished over-parameterization,
- and was allowed to **break the theory** if a claim could not survive.

Negative results were treated as first-class outcomes.

## Phase-I Canonical Toy Set

While earlier toys are retained for provenance, **Toy11–Toy15** define the
official Phase-I validation and closure program.

---

## Toy11 — Identity / Superselection Stability

**Purpose:**  
Test whether an identity-like sector can remain practically stable under
open-system dynamics.

**Key Result:**  
A bounded region of parameter space exists where:
- sector leakage remains below 1%,
- stability persists over long windows,
- Zeno-like stabilization suppresses transitions.

**Impact on Theory:**  
Identity persistence is **mathematically plausible** without exotic physics.
This became the **strongest surviving pillar** of SCSM.

## Toy12 Series — Boundary Phenomenology

### Toy12 / Toy12A — Boundary Battlefield

**Purpose:**  
Generate realistic synthetic boundary-force datasets under noise, drift,
and mixed truth models.

**Key Result:**  
Boundary signals are realistically messy; no single clean functional form
dominates under noise.

---

### Toy12B — Boundary Model Selection

**Purpose:**  
Determine whether static boundary curves uniquely identify the underlying model.

**Key Result:**  
Plateau-like corrections can win sometimes, but power-law and patch models
often win instead; mixtures confound selection.

**Impact on Theory:**  
Static boundary curves are **not uniquely diagnostic**.  
Boundary effects are treated as **measurement channels**, not signatures.

---

## Toy13 — Joint Passive Evidence Failure

**Purpose:**  
Test whether combining boundary curves with passive spectral features improves
identifiability.

**Key Result:**  
Joint passive evidence performs **worse** than boundary-only models.

**Impact on Theory:**  
Passive correlations and generic resonances are **eliminated** as viable claims.

---

## Toy14 — Active χ Identifiability Limits

**Purpose:**  
Test whether active probing can distinguish weakly nonlinear χ-like mediators
from adversarial nulls.

**Key Result:**  
- Causal lag distinguishes models in principle,
- but coherence and harmonic signatures provide no usable discrimination
  at realistic signal-to-noise ratios.

**Impact on Theory:**  
Weak χ phenomenology is **experimentally undetectable**.

---

## Toy15 — Nonlinear / Threshold χ Closure

**Purpose:**  
Test whether strongly nonlinear or thresholded χ variants produce
non-degenerate active fingerprints.

**Key Result:**  
- 0% truth recovery under realistic conditions,
- numerical instability and null mimicry dominate,
- no reliable harmonic or causal signature emerges.

**Impact on Theory:**  
All detectable χ phenomenology — weak or strong — is **explicitly ruled out**.
χ is demoted to *EFT-permitted but empirically undetectable*.

This toy delivered **final Phase-I closure**.

---

## Phase-I Completion Statement

Phase-I is considered complete because:

- All surviving claims have passed adversarial toy testing.
- All eliminated mechanisms are explicitly documented.
- No remaining claim relies on ambiguity or undefined structure.

There are **no open phenomenological pathways** left in Phase-I.

## Summary

> The Phase-I toy program transformed SCSM from a broad speculative proposal
> into a lean, tightly scoped, and fully falsifiable framework by systematically
> eliminating claims that could not survive adversarial modeling, while
> validating topological persistence and boundary observability as the
> remaining core pillars.
