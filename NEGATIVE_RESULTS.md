# Negative Results and Eliminated Pathways

This document records **explicit negative results** from the Phase-I toy program.
These outcomes are treated as first-class scientific results and define
mechanisms that are **closed** in SCSM v11.5.3.

Claims eliminated here are not deferred to future work unless new empirical
data becomes available.

## Design Principle

Negative results were accepted when a mechanism was shown to be:

- experimentally indistinguishable from noise,
- degenerate with adversarial nulls,
- unstable under realistic conditions,
- or reliant on coincidence rather than causal structure.

No eliminated pathway remains an active claim in Phase-I.

## Passive Spectral Signatures (Toy13)

**Tested Claim:**  
Boundary anomalies combined with passive spectral features (e.g. kHz peaks)
could uniquely identify underlying dynamics.

**Result:**  
- Joint passive evidence performed **worse** than boundary-only models.
- Generic resonances increased model degeneracy without information gain.

**Conclusion:**  
Passive spectral correlations are **not** a viable detection pathway.

**Status:** Closed.

## Weak χ Phenomenology (Toy14)

**Tested Claim:**  
A weakly nonlinear χ-like mediator could be detected via coherence,
harmonics, or phase signatures under active probing.

**Result:**  
- Coherence was trivially high for both signal and nulls.
- Harmonic signatures were absent or unusable at realistic SNR.
- Only causal lag distinguished models in principle, but not robustly.

**Conclusion:**  
Weak χ phenomenology is **experimentally undetectable**.

**Status:** Closed.

## Strongly Nonlinear / Threshold χ (Toy15)

**Tested Claim:**  
Strong nonlinearity, threshold behavior, or hysteresis could rescue χ
detectability.

**Result:**  
- 0% truth recovery under adversarial conditions.
- Numerical instability dominated (e.g. cubic overflow).
- Null models produced indistinguishable or misleading signatures.
- Harmonic ratios and causal metrics failed to separate truth from nulls.

**Conclusion:**  
Even strongly nonlinear or threshold χ variants are
**experimentally indistinguishable from noise** under realistic conditions.

χ is therefore classified as:
> *EFT-permitted in principle but empirically undetectable.*

**Status:** Permanently closed (Phase-I).

## Summary of Eliminations

| Pathway | Outcome | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Passive spectral signatures | Degenerate, misleading | Closed |
| Weak χ mediation | Undetectable at realistic SNR | Closed |
| Strong / nonlinear χ | Unstable, null-mimicked | Closed |

## Phase-I Closure Statement

All phenomenological pathways eliminated in this document were tested
adversarially and failed under realistic conditions.

No eliminated mechanism is retained, softened, or deferred in
SCSM v11.5.3.

Future revisions require **new empirical data**, not reinterpretation of
these results.
