# Changelog

All notable changes to the Speculative Consciousness Substrate Model (SCSM)
are documented in this file. Versioning reflects conceptual maturity rather
than software features.

## v11.5.3 — Phase-I Closure (December 2025)

**Status:** Phase-I complete

### Added
- Explicit Phase-I closure definition and status.
- Formal documentation of adversarial toy program (Toy11–Toy15).
- Single decisive Phase-II experimental choke point.

### Changed
- Identity persistence re-framed as a **TQEC-protected superselection structure**
  (mathematical existence proof level).
- Boundary phenomenology re-scoped as **necessary but non-unique** observables.
- χ mediation reclassified as *EFT-permitted but empirically undetectable*.

### Removed / Eliminated
- All passive spectral signature claims.
- All detectable χ phenomenology, including strongly nonlinear and thresholded variants
  (closed via Toy14 and Toy15).
- Any claim relying on coincidence-based or non-causal correlations.

### Fixed
- Coherence threshold explicitly defined and enforced.
- Falsification criteria made explicit and time-bounded.
- Internal consistency across theory, toys, and status documentation.

### Notes
- No open speculative mechanisms remain in Phase-I.
- Future version changes require **new empirical data** (Phase-II), not further
  theoretical refinement.

## Pre-Phase-I Versions (≤ v11.2)

Earlier versions explored broader ontological and phenomenological territory,
including mechanisms later eliminated during Phase-I adversarial testing.
These versions are preserved in separate repositories for provenance only and
are not part of the Phase-I-complete physics framework.
