# SCSM Status Summary — December 2025

## Overall Maturity

- **Current version:** SCSM v11.5.3  
- **Phase-I status:** **100% complete** (internal consistency + toy-level falsifiability map)  
- **Nature:** Rigorous *speculative* but fully **falsifiable** physics framework with a single
  decisive near-term experimental test.

This repository represents the **Phase-I endpoint** of SCSM after systematic
elimination of ambiguous or experimentally non-viable mechanisms.

## Core Pillars (All Survived)

### 1. Ontological Axioms (v6.0 → v11.5.3)

- Primordial substrate, identity persistence, locality, non-teleology, and
  boundary phenomenology remain intact.
- No original **ontological axiom** was discarded; only over-optimistic
  *phenomenological mechanisms* were removed during Phase-I.

---

### 2. Identity as Topological / Superselection Structure

- Identity persistence is modeled as a **topologically protected
  superselection sector**, grounded via TQEC-style protection.
- Adversarial toy models demonstrate regions of **practical stability**
  (leakage < 1%) under open-system dynamics.
- This is the **strongest surviving pillar** of the framework.

---

### 3. Boundary Phenomenology (Casimir-Scale)

- Boundary effects are confirmed as **legitimate but non-unique observables**:
  they provide a *measurement channel*, not a unique fingerprint.
- Static boundary curves alone are explicitly acknowledged as insufficient.
- Boundary phenomenology defines the **sole Phase-II experimental choke point**.

---

## What Was Cut or Downgraded

### χ Phenomenology (All Forms)

- Weak, generic, and even strongly nonlinear / threshold χ variants were tested
  in adversarial toy models.
- All forms were found to be **experimentally indistinguishable from noise**
  at realistic signal-to-noise ratios.
- χ is now treated as *EFT-permitted in principle* but **empirically undetectable**
  and is **not** a claimed signature.

---

### Passive Spectral Signatures

- Joint “boundary + kHz peak” evidence performed worse than boundary-only models.
- Passive correlations and coincidence-based signatures are explicitly ruled out
  as viable detection pathways.

---

## Phase-I Completion Definition

Phase-I is considered complete because:

- All internal claims have been subjected to adversarial toy modeling.
- All surviving pillars have explicit pass/fail conditions.
- No remaining claim relies on ambiguity, hand-waving, or undefined mechanisms.
- All eliminated pathways are documented and closed.

There are **no open speculative mechanisms** remaining in Phase-I.

---

## Where This Stands in Physics

- **Category:** Legitimate speculative hypothesis.
- **Status:** Not an established physical theory; awaiting empirical test.
- **Strengths:** Mathematical structure, tight scoping, explicit falsifiability.
- **Limitations:** No experimental confirmation to date.

---

## Next Step: Phase-II / Experimental

- **Single decisive experiment:**  
  High-precision, cryogenic boundary-force measurement (e.g. Casimir-style setup).

- **Outcome space:**  
  - Detection within the predicted narrow window → supports boundary phenomenology
    and keeps the framework viable.  
  - Clean non-detection under agreed conditions → falsifies the remaining
    phenomenological claims.

## One-Line Completion Snapshot

> **SCSM v11.5.3 is a fully Phase-I-complete, toy-vetted speculative framework
> that preserves its ontological core, has eliminated all weak or ambiguous
> mechanisms, and now stands on a small set of hard, clearly testable claims
> awaiting a single decisive experimental check.**
