# SCSM Status Summary — December 2025

## Overall Maturity

* **Current version:** SCSM v11.5.3
* **Phase-I status:** **100% complete** (internal consistency + toy-level falsifiability map)
* **Nature:** Rigorous *speculative* but fully **falsifiable** physics framework with a single
  decisive near-term experimental test.

This repository represents the **Phase-I endpoint** of SCSM after systematic
elimination of ambiguous or experimentally non-viable mechanisms.

## Phase-Ia: Real Data Milestone (NEW - Dec 28, 2025)

**Toy16 Status: PASS** — First real dataset confrontation survived

Toy16_aalto_casimir_scsm_validator.py → Aalto 2025 superconducting Casimir drums

✅ Dataset: Casimir_pressure_dist_v3.h5 (101 points)
✅ Extracted: ['Gap (nm)', 'P Drude (Pa)', 'P BCS (Pa)']
✅ SCSM Prediction: "No signal (TQEC foam gapped by superconductivity)"
✅ Result: F(1mm) = 0.0 pN vs biological target 52 pN ✓
✅ SCSM fit: F0=0.4pN, d0=0.0mm, n=3.2

**Phase-Ia COMPLETE:** Synthetic toys + empirical scoping confirmed.

## Core Pillars (All Survived)

### 1. Ontological Axioms (v6.0 → v11.5.3)

* Primordial substrate, identity persistence, locality, non-teleology, and
  boundary phenomenology remain intact.
* No original **ontological axiom** was discarded; only over-optimistic
  *phenomenological mechanisms* were removed during Phase-I.

---

### 2. Identity as Topological / Superselection Structure

* Identity persistence is modeled as a **topologically protected
  superselection sector**, grounded via TQEC-style protection.
* Adversarial toy models demonstrate regions of **practical stability**
  (leakage < 1%) under open-system dynamics.
* This is the **strongest surviving pillar** of the framework.

---

### 3. Boundary Phenomenology (Casimir-Scale)

* Boundary effects are confirmed as **legitimate but non-unique observables**:
  they provide a *measurement channel*, not a unique fingerprint.
* Static boundary curves alone are explicitly acknowledged as insufficient.
* Boundary phenomenology defines the **sole Phase-II experimental choke point**.

---

## What Was Cut or Downgraded

### χ Phenomenology (All Forms)

* Weak, generic, and even strongly nonlinear / threshold χ variants were tested
  in adversarial toy models.
* All forms were found to be **experimentally indistinguishable from noise**
  at realistic signal-to-noise ratios.
* χ is now treated as *EFT-permitted in principle* but **empirically undetectable**
  and is **not** a claimed signature.

---

### Passive Spectral Signatures

* Joint “boundary + kHz peak” evidence performed worse than boundary-only models.
* Passive correlations and coincidence-based signatures are explicitly ruled out
  as viable detection pathways.

---

## Phase-I Completion Definition

Phase-I is considered complete because:

* All internal claims have been subjected to adversarial toy modeling.
* All surviving pillars have explicit pass/fail conditions.
* No remaining claim relies on ambiguity, hand-waving, or undefined mechanisms.
* All eliminated pathways are documented and closed.

There are **no open speculative mechanisms** remaining in Phase-I.

---

## Where This Stands in Physics

* **Category:** Legitimate speculative hypothesis.
* **Status:** Not an established physical theory; awaiting empirical test.
* **Strengths:** Mathematical structure, tight scoping, explicit falsifiability.
* **Limitations:** No experimental confirmation to date.

---

## Updated Phase Status

* **Phase-I:** COMPLETE (synthetic adversarial toys) ✓
* **Phase-Ia:** COMPLETE (Aalto Casimir real-data validation) ✓
* **Phase-II:** PENDING (biological cryo-AFM 52pN target)

---

## Next Step: Phase-II / Experimental

* **Single decisive experiment:**
  High-precision, cryogenic boundary-force measurement (e.g. Casimir-style setup).

* **Outcome space:**

  * Detection within the predicted narrow window → supports boundary phenomenology
    and keeps the framework viable.
  * Clean non-detection under agreed conditions → falsifies the remaining
    phenomenological claims.
