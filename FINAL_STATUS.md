# SCSM v11.5.3 — Program Status (Final)

**Status:** CLOSED

After Phase-I (adversarial toy validation) and Phase-Ia (real-data null survival),
the SCSM program has reached a definitive conclusion.

## Summary

- **Claim A (Topological persistence as a mathematical existence result):**
  Remains valid as a scoped, non-empirical statement.
- **Claim B (Boundary phenomenology / Phase-II bio-Casimir test):**
  Determined to be empirically non-viable under current physical theory
  and experimental constraints.

## Reason for Closure

The program is closed due to independent, non-negotiable blockers:
- No diffeomorphism-invariant TQEC embedding
- Undefined locality for perturbations in curved spacetime
- Infeasible experimental regime (thermal Casimir + systematics)
- Phase-II execution beyond credible near-term capability

This conclusion reflects physical and feasibility limits, not internal inconsistency.

## Closure Policy

No further theoretical refinement or experimental pursuit is planned
unless:
- a diffeomorphism-invariant TQEC framework is discovered, or
- radically new experimental capability emerges.

All materials remain archived for transparency and reference.
