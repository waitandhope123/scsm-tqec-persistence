# Falsification Criteria

This document defines the **explicit falsification conditions** for the
remaining claims of SCSM v11.5.3.

If the conditions below are met, the corresponding claims are considered
**falsified**, not postponed or reinterpreted.

---

## Scope of Falsification

Following Phase-I closure, SCSM makes **only two surviving classes of claims**:

1. **Mathematical existence** of topologically protected persistence sectors
   (existence-proof level; not directly falsifiable by experiment).
2. **Boundary phenomenology** as a measurable open-system effect at
   experimentally accessible scales.

Only the second class is subject to experimental falsification.

---

## Claim A — Topological Persistence Sectors

**Claim:**  
Identity persistence can be realized as a topologically protected
superselection structure with exponentially suppressed leakage.

**Status:**  
Mathematical existence claim only.

**Falsification Mode:**  
Not subject to direct experimental falsification at Phase-I.
This claim stands or falls on mathematical consistency and correctness.

---

## Claim B — Boundary Phenomenology

**Claim:**  
Topologically protected persistence sectors admit a measurable boundary
phenomenology under open-system dynamics at mesoscopic scales.

---

### Primary Phase-II Test

**Experiment Type:**  
High-precision, cryogenic boundary-force measurement
(Casimir-style setup with multi-channel monitoring).

**Predicted Signal Window:**  
- Force anomaly at the **pN scale** under specific geometric and coherence
  conditions.
- Correlated behavior across mechanical and dynamical channels.

---

### Falsification Conditions

Claim B is considered **falsified** if:

1. No statistically significant anomaly is observed within the predicted
   force window under agreed experimental conditions, **and**
2. Null models (including drift, patch potentials, and instrumental artifacts)
   adequately explain all observed behavior.

Failure under these conditions closes the remaining phenomenological claim.

---

## Interpretation of Outcomes

| Outcome | Interpretation |
|------|---------------|
| Clear detection in predicted window | Boundary phenomenology supported |
| Ambiguous / degenerate signal | Inconclusive; no claim upgrade |
| Clean non-detection | Boundary claim falsified |

No outcome upgrades the theory beyond its stated scope.

---

## Time Horizon

- **Phase-II execution window:** 2026–2028
- **Evaluation:** Based on reproducible, peer-reviewed experimental results

---

## Closure Policy

If Claim B is falsified:

- The mathematical existence result remains intact.
- No alternative phenomenological mechanisms are introduced.
- SCSM transitions to a closed speculative result.

There are **no fallback pathways** defined in Phase-I.
